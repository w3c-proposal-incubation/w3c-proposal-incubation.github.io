    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The Bullet Chatting is called a comment (コメント/comment) in Japan. It refers to a comment or comment floating on the
      video in a certain way at a specific point in time of the video, which can bring interesting and unexpected
      experiences to the video viewing. Only when a large number of comments appear on the screen at the same time,
      people call this state a "Bullet Chatting." In China, in order to avoid conflict with the function of the original
      comment, it was renamed the Bullet Chatting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bullet Chatting first appeared on the Japanese niconico (ニコニコ) Bullet Chatting video site. In China, in
      addition to the Bullet Chatting video sites such as Bilibili and Acfun, most video sites, such as MiGu video,
      Tencent video, iQiyi video, Youku video, etc., have a Bullet Chatting function.

          occupancy in each layer does not overlap.
        </li>
        <li>
          Deterministic of rendering: If the Bullet Chatting area and the rendered list are fixed, then the position and
          order of each Bullet Chatting is fixed each time it is rendered.

    <h2>Scenarios</h2>
    This section mainly describes the specific use scenarios of the Bullet Chatting.
    <section>
      <h2>On-demand video interaction</h2>

        is needed to meet this demand. Through the Bullet Chatting, the viewer's comments at the same time can be
        displayed in the video area by scrolling in a fixed direction, or statically displayed at the top or bottom of
        the video area, which can increase the interactive characteristics of the viewer and the video and the viewer.
        Interaction between the two. The Bullet Chatting sent at the same time basically has the same theme.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this scenario, the Bullet Chatting data is generally offline data (not real-time), and there is also a small
        amount of real-time data.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Live video interaction</h2>
      <p>The Bullet Chatting can also be a direct interaction between the anchor and the viewer in the live video

        audience's needs and feedback according to the display of the Bullet Chatting on the screen, more convenient to
        adjust the next action and processing, and can also interact according to the user's input.</p>

      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Identify video highlights</h2>
      <p>
        Since the Bullet Chatting will only appear at a specific point in the video, if there is a large number of
        Bullet Chatting at a certain point in time, it means that the time point has bright spots and high energy. The
        audience is interested in this time point event and can also be used as video management and Recommended
        reference data for other functions.

        the viewer can enhance the video by superimposing on the video by the Bullet Chatting. The effect at this time
        is to achieve a better experience. For example, the victory of the game, the climax of the plot to render the
